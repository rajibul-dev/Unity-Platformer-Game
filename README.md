## About Project

This is a Udemy course project which I'm using to learn Game Development! I can choose to derrive from how the course build this game and have some of my own iteratons and experimentations as I learn.

### Roadmap

[] Adding my own touch to the game

## Expectations

This is a hobby project, so I’m not promising a polished, fully playable game for others. My real focus is on learning, experimenting, and enjoying the creative process—and so far, I’m loving it! As someone who’s played games for years, being able to actually build one feels really special. At the same time, I don’t know if game development will ever become a bigger pursuit for me, or just stay something I explore personally. It’s a challenging craft, and I’m still figuring out where it fits into my journey—but that’s okay. For now, I’m just grateful for the fun and growth it’s giving me. The journey itself is what matters, and I’m excited to see where it takes me.
